This exercise is about analyzing Medicare hospitals data to answer some of questions
related to hospital quality across different procedures. I used csv files available
in the Medicare website as data source, loaded the data into HDFS data lake, and
analyzed the data using Hive.

I stored the data in three different tables:
	1) hospitals table which has hospital name and state info
	2) procedures table which lists out all procedures/hospitals pair
	   that are available in the original raw data
	3) patient survey results table which has survey score for each hospital

When analyzing the data, I filtered the hospitals with at least 25 different measures
reported to make sure we evaluate quality of hospitals with sufficient amount of
data points available. Also, to measure the consistent hospital quality, I used
variablity adjusted average score which is calculated by average score across
different procedures divided by standard deviation of such scores. For state comparison,
I filtered the states which at least have 10 hospitals to make sure we compare
states with enough number of hosptials. To measure correlation between certain metrics,
I used Pearson correlation coefficient.

In terms of scores, I made the below assumptions:
	1) each measure has the same scale of score
	2) higher score means better hospital quality
	3) lack of score for certain measure means that measure is not applicable
	   for hospitals lacking such score
