IN      5.54822093841943
ME      5.372585071420147

These states have the highest variability adjusted state score.

Similar to variability adjusted hospital score, the variability adjusted
state score is calculated by dividing average of hospital scores for different
hospitals in each state by standard deviation of such scores. When calculating
such metric, the states with number of hospitals less than 10 are excluded
to make sure we are comparing states with enough number of hospitals available.

The variability adjusted state score is appropriate for state health care
quality comparison purpose because it measures both level of scores across different
hospitals and consistency of such scores in each state.
