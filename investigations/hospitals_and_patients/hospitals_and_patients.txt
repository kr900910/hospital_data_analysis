To answer the question "are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability
correlated with patient survey responses?", I calculated correlation coefficient of
average procedure score and survey score, correlation coefficient of standard deviation
of procedure scores and survey score, and correlation coefficient of variability adjusted
average score and survey score.

The first coefficient is -0.37, and this shows that average procedure score is negatively
correlated with patient survey score. This is unexpected because we might
think hospitals with higher average scores will have higher survey scores.

The second coefficient is -0.33, and it demonstrates standard deviation of scores is
negatively correlated with patient survey score. This is expected since more variability
across different procedures is considered negative.

The last coefficient is 0.11, and it demonstrates variability adjusted average
score (average / standard deviation) is positively correlated with survey
score. However, this number is pretty low, so we can conclude that there is no relationship
between variability adjusted average score and survey score.
