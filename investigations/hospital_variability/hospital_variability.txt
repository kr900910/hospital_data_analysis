Standard deviation is a good measure of variability, and using standard deviation
of scores across different hospitals, we can find out procedures with greatest
variability. When calculating standard deviation, the procedures with number of
hospitals which reported such procedures less than 2400 are excluded. This is to make
sure we are comparing procedures with enough data points available. 2400 is
around half of number of unique hospitals.
