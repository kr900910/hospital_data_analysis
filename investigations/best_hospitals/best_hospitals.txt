These hospitals have the highest variability adjusted hospital scores.

The variability adjusted hospital score is calculated by dividing
average of quality scores across different procedures for each hospital by
standard deviation of such scores. When calculating such metric, the hospitals
with number of reported procedures less than 25 are excluded. This is to make
sure we are comparing hospitals with enough data points available. 25 is
around half of number of unique procedures used in my analysis (which is 49).

The variability adjusted hospital score is appropriate for hospital
comparison purpose because it measures both level of scores across different
procedures and consistency of such scores.
